# basic-data-structures

Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to read this.
As of January 20, 2018, this project is still under contruction.


##Introduction
In order for me to solidify fundamental concepts in computer science, I have decided to implement the following 
data structures using JavaScript:

* Queue
* Stack
* Linked List
* Tree
* Set
* Graph
* Binary Search Tree
* Hash Map

##Future:
There is always room for improvement and further implementation.

These are all 'maybes'

* Doubly Linked List
* Heap
* Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree
